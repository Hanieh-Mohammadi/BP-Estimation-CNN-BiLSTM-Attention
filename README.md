# CNN–BiLSTM–Attention Framework for Blood Pressure Estimation

This repository provides the implementation of the proposed deep learning framework described in our manuscript:

**"Non-Invasive Blood Pressure Estimation Using PPG and a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention Deep Learning Architecture"**  
(Submitted to IEEE Access, currently under review)

---

## Overview

The proposed model estimates continuous arterial blood pressure (ABP) waveforms from photoplethysmography (PPG) signals using:
- A CNN-based feature extractor  
- BiLSTM layers for temporal modeling  
- Attention mechanism to emphasize informative waveform regions

---

## Dataset

Experiments were conducted using the public **MIMIC-II waveform database**.
